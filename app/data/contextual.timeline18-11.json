"text": "Northrop Grumman and Airbus parent EADS defeat Boeing for $ 40 billion US airtanker contract March 1 , 2008 Northrop Grumman and Airbus parent company European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company EADS N.V. ( EADS ) have unexpectedly defeated Boeing for a US$ 40 billion ( GB # 20.1 billion ) contract to supply the United States Air Force ( USAF ) with 179 new aerial refueling tankers at a rate of 15 a year . It is the biggest contract of its kind since the Joint Strike Fighter program . That contract was fought for between Boeing and Lockheed Martin , Lockheed ultimately winning the contest . JSA Research defence analysist Paul Nesbit said that Maintenance , Repair and Overhaul ( MRO ) operations across the aircraft 's fifty-year service life could push the value of the contract as high as US$ 100 billion . Northrop Grumman CEO Ron Sugar said in an interview `` Everyone told us we were crazy , that we had no chance . But we took a big swing and in this case , we hit a home run . '' USAF officials said that the contract had been awarded based on competence , track record and competitive pricing , with UBS analyst David Strauss saying `` The key decision was the amount of fuel the bigger plane could carry . In the armed services , you can never have too much gas in the air . '' USAF also denied that creating jobs in the US was a factor ; job supply had been the reason Boeing were expected to win , with the airframer promising 44,000 new positions at 300 suppliers in 40 states . The Northrop Grumman KC-45 tankers - more often known as KC-30s - are based on the Airbus A330 MRTT . The first four aircraft will be assembled at the main Airbus factory in Toulouse , France but by 2010-11 production of the remainder will be carried out at a facility in Mobile , Alabama . This is thought likely to create 1,500 to 2,000 jobs and support 25,000 others . 60 % of the parts will be supplied by domestic manufacturers . EADS had previously announced plans to shift much production to the US due to the current weakness of the dollar . General Arthur Lichte , head of USAF 's Mobility Command , said it is hoped the first aircraft can be tested in 2010 and in operation three years afterwards . USAF 's chief of staff General Duncan McNab stated `` The tanker is the number-one procurement priority for us right now . It is the first step in our critical commitment to recapitalize our aging fleet to move , supply , and position assets anywhere . '' There is still a possibility of Boeing challenging the decision ; Boeing themselves were successfuly challenged by Lockheed and Sikorsky in 2006 over a US$ 10 billion contract to supply search and rescue helicopters to the Pentagon . A statement by Boeing given by Boeing spokesman William Barksdale said `` Obviously we are very disappointed ... Once we have reviewed the details behind the award , we will make a decision concerning our possible options . '' Washington senator Patty Murray , who hails from the same state where Boeing bases their commercial airliner operations , said in a critical statement `` We are shocked that the Air Force tapped a European company and its foreign workers to provide a tanker to our American military . At a time when our economy is hurting , this decision to outsource our tankers is a blow to the American aerospace industry , American workers and America 's military . '' Washington representative Norm Dicks said he too was `` shocked '' , releasing a statement saying `` This decision is even more disappointing because the Air Force had previously favored the Boeing 767 tanker and we were prepared to move forward with the production of 100 tankers in 2003 , before the process was halted due to the Boeing scandal . I regret that it has taken so long to respond to what was -- and is -- an urgent need to replace these older aircraft . And even more regrettable is the decision to award the contract to Airbus , which has consistently used unfair European government subsidies to take jobs away from American aircraft workers . '' Kansas senator Sam Brownback said `` It 's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to Europe instead of building them in America . I' ll be calling upon the Secretary of Defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by Boeing . '' Todd Tiahrt , a Kansas representative , said `` We should have an American tanker built by an American company with American workers . I can not believe we would create French jobs in place of Kansas jobs . '' A group of Washington politicians released a joint statement saying `` We will be asking tough questions about the decision to outsource this contract ... At a time when our economy is hurting , this is a blow not only to our state , but more than 40 states across the country who would help build this national plane . '' Alabama Governor Bob Riley said `` To say this is a great day for Alabama is a monumental understatement . This will go down in history as one of our greatest days . '' Ralph Crosby , EADS 's North America CEO and ex Northrop executive commented the business has `` committed our full resources to support this vital program for our prime contractor , Northrop Grumman , the Air Force , and the war fighters that this system will serve for decades to come . We already have begun the work necessary to expand our U.S. industrial footprint in support of this important program . '' EADS chief executive Louis Gallois commented `` This major selection is a win-win for our customers , for allied industrial cooperation and for EADS . It signals a quantum-leap forward in our commitment to the US defence customer , reflects and supports our global strategy to increase EADS 's industrial presence in key markets and our goal to balance the company 's defence and commercial portfolios . '' General Arthur Lichte said `` This will be an American tanker , flown by American airmen with an American flag on its tail and , every day , it will be saving American lives . Boeing had initially agreed to lease 100 tankers , but in 2003 a scandal erupted when it emerged that Boeing executive Michael M. Sears arranged a job for USAF official Darleen Druyun while negotiations were still underway . Both served jail sentences for corruption charges and a competition was opened up to award a new contract .",

"text": "Boeing pushes back 737 replacement development May 24 , 2008 United States airframer Boeing has announced that development of a replacement for their 737 narrowbody airliner , begun two years ago , has been pushed back several years , Boeing saying that further advancement of technology is required . Spokeswoman Sandy Angers said that that the team formed to look at the development had been merged into the parent product development team and would cease looking at specific designs . Boeing say airlines demand performance improvements of 15-20 % are required if a new airliner is to be commercially viable . `` We 've reduced our airplane-design effort and are focusing more on the technology breakthroughs , '' said Angers . `` We need technology breakthroughs in engines , aerodynamics , materials and other systems . You ca n't simply shrink the 787 and expect the same benefits for the narrow-body market . We 've got difficult challenges . '' One important difference is that the plastic composite used for the fuselage of the 787 would not offer as significant a weight saving on a smaller aircraft . The delivery date for the plane is now anticipated to be around 2020 , and not 2015 as previously hoped . This coincides with the expected date for Airbus to deliver their A320 replacement . Industry analysts predict development of one to trigger development of the other . Boeing had hoped to have their 's ready for 2012 . Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Scott Carson said `` We 're continuing our research effort until we find the right solution . It has to be a 25-year product . '' Since its 1967 debut 5,700 737s have been deliverd to date , with orders for 2,200 more , keeping the jet in production until at least 2014 . It is Boeing 's most popular airliner .",

"text": "Government Accountability Office requests rerun of US Air Force tanker bid July 2 , 2008 The Government Accountability Office on June 18 called for a re-run of the bidding for the U.S. Air Force $ 40 billion tanker contract , citing major flaws in the procurement process . This imperils the Northrop Grumman and EADS North America plan to assemble the planes in Mobile , Alabama . When the Air Force selected Los Angeles based Northrop Grumman on February 29 to build the aircraft , Boeing challenged the award in a formal protest before the GAO , claiming the evaluation was skewed towards Northrop . The GAO upheld Boeing 's protest , though not all of their individual claims were upheld . `` Our review of the record led us to conclude that the Air Force had made a number of significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman , '' said Michael R. Golden , the GAO 's managing associate general counsel for procurement law . The GAO issued a non-binding recommendation that the Air Force re-open the competition , allow the competitors to submit revised bids , and completely re-evaluate the new bids . This process could take a year or more to complete . The Air Force has 60 days to respond to the GAO .",

This brings Ryanair 's total number of outstanding orders with the US manufacturer to 230 . The new planes , which come from the 737-800 range , will be fitted with blended winglets to boost fuel efficiency by as much as 3 % . Ryanair CEO , Michael O' Leary , justified his choice of Boeing by saying , `` The Boeing 737-800 has the best technical reliability and ensures that Ryanair is the number one on-time major airline in Europe '' ... `` In addition , it has the lowest unit operating cost . The addition of these five aircraft will continue to enable us to develop more new routes across Europe and bring low fares to many more European consumers . '' Ryanair is the world 's most profitable airline , having reported record profits of $ 269m earlier this year , and is pursuing an aggressive expansion plan which will see it 's total number of passengers jump to 70m over the next few years . At present Ryanair has 91 aircraft and 230 on order .",

"text": "Internal emails expose Boeing-Air Force contract discussions November 24 , 2004 Emails exchanged among United States Air Force officials regarding a USD$ 23 billion dollar deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing have been entered into the public record . Senator John McCain ( R-AZ ) entered them into the Congressional Record during a speech last week against the now-cancelled deal to lease 100 mid-air tanker aircraft from Boeing . Congressional lawmakers rejected the proposal in October , although industry experts say the deal had been killed by the Pentagon because of reports stating that the deal had favored Boeing . Senator McCain has been the deal 's most vocal critic . The original negotiations with Boeing were over a no-bid contract . Such contracts are often justified by the speed they offer , eliminating a preliminary bid and selection round that may last months . However , no-bid contracts are only open to the company selected by the procuring agency . This leaves no-bid contracts open to accusations of conflicts of interest among the procurement personnel . Such accusations have previously been leveled against Vice President Dick Cheney for a no-bid contract to Halliburton , and are now being made against senior Air Force officials for choosing Boeing to replace its tanker fleet . In the released emails , Air Force officials responsible for the awarding of contracts appear biased against Boeing 's main competitor , Airbus and its CEO Ralph Crosby . Airbus is owned by European Aeronautic Defense & Space Company ( EADS ) . Airbus manufacturers a number of passenger and military aircraft and has gained market share in passenger aircraft over Boeing in recent years . The following is a sequential email exchange regarding Airbus as recorded in the Congressional Record : : Special Asst. to the Secretary and Director of Air Force Communications Bill Bodie : `` We do n't have to turn the other cheek , you know . I' m ready to tell the truth about Airbus 's boom , footprint , and financial shortcoming . But maybe we should sleep on it . '' : Secretary of the Air Force James Roche : `` No , Sir , save it and blow him away . He admits that they were not technically qualified ! And , we keep their record of bribes as our trump card ! Jim . '' : Civilian Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Darleen Druyun : `` I read with disgust the article on Airbus tankers from the new EADS CEO of North America . What BS ... should not have been surprised at the slime ... his day of reckoning will come hopefully . '' : Secretary of the Air Force James Roche : `` Oy . I agree . I had hoped you would have stayed and tortured him slowly over the next few years until EADS got rid of him ! Jim . '' An email from Burkhardt & Associates to James Roche advises the Secretary to release fiscal numbers favorable to Boeing , apparently regardless of the facts : ''I' d distribute a one page memo saying the per plane cost of the lease will not be greater than x and have x be less than the last lease Boeing did for some commercial entity -- or that x is y dollars less than the cost of a new tanker , '' it said . An additional email by Roche provides a stark contrast to his criticism of Airbus , as he talks to Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Marvin Sambur about Boeing , saying , `` I love Ya , Big Guy . Give it to the Blue Eyed Arabs of the North ( the expression we used for Boeing ) . '' GovExec.com quotes a `` Senate aide '' as saying : `` The House language [ of the spending bill ] ignores an analysis of alternatives called for in last year 's authorizing language and by Pentagon Acquisition Director Michael Wynne and the DSB . It precludes such an analysis and predetermines the outcome in favor of the Boeing 767 before the study is even initiated . '' The activist organization the Project on Government Oversight has called it `` a textbook case of favoritism to a single defense contractor . '' Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Marvin Sambur defended the Air Force 's exclusive consideration of Boeing , saying , `` This was not a competitive bid process . The Air Force was ordered by Congress to work with Boeing on the new tanker program . '' Boeing had previously hired Civilian Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Darleen Druyun . This caused a controversy over conflict of interest and led to felony charges against Boeing Chief Financial Officer Michael Sears for illegally hiring her . Former military personnel are often hired by defense contractors to lobby for contracts . Days after Sen. McCain 's remarks , the Air Force said the tanker replacement contract would be revived as an open bid . Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz published an open-article in the Congressional Record , saying : `` After we have selected an appropriate alternative , we intend to require competition . ''",

"text": "Airbus offers funding to search for black boxes from Air France disaster July 30 , 2009 Airbus have announced that they will be willing to contribute between $ 12 million and $ 20 million ( about US$ 16 million to $ 28 million ) to fund an extended search for the black boxes from Air France Flight 447 . The Airbus A330 jetliner crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in June , killing all 228 people on board . Chief executive Thomas Enders said in a statement , `` We want to know what happened , as improving air safety is our top priority . We are fully committed to support the extension of the search with a significant contribution . '' Although airframers normally supply technical assistance to investigations , the required impartiality makes funding rare , with Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath saying the company 's move was unprecedented . `` This is an exceptional accident and an exceptional situation , '' Schaffrath explained . France 's investigative agency BEA has requested financial assistance for the search from both Airbus and Air France . Air France have discussed this possibility with the BEA . Investigators have already given up looking for the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder using the conventional method of tracing audio ` pingers ' , the batteries of which would have expired after 30 -- 40 days . Efforts are ongoing using sensitive equipment under tow from a French naval vessel , but if this search proves fruitless then the BEA will seek money for a further three-month search . The jet 's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System ( ACARS ) was able to transmit information regarding problems on board prior to the crash . The ACARS data suggests that the plane had suffered from a loss of valuable readings including airspeed , leading suspicion to fall on the pitot-static system which supplies various measurements . Airbus had already recommended that one component of this system , the pitot tubes , be replaced on A330s . Air France had not done this on the accident airplane although the entire fleet now features the modified design . Three other incidents have been identified since that may involve similar circumstances . The United States National Transportation Safety Board is probing two over American soil while earlier this month another Air France A330 equipped with the new tubes suffered a similar series of problems enroute from Italy to France .",

The problem was relatively minor , and affected the software controlling its engines . The glitch was not reported when the plane made its maiden flight on 11 December -- four years behind schedule and $ 7.3 billion over budget , due to what the manufacturers call `` political interference '' -- and only became public attention this weekend , when German magazine Der Spiegel cited confidential documents from engine maker Europrop in a report . The steering computer and backup system failed after thirty minutes . The issue has been resolved , according to Airbus spokesman Jaime Perez-Guerra . Apparently , the glitch led the pilots to disengage an engine , allowing its blades to turn freely . Since then , he says , the plane has flown for nearly thirty hours and is exceeding expectations . However , additional costs were involved , and European aerospace contractor EADS wants this cost to be shouldered by the seven customer nations : Belgium , France , Germany , Luxembourg , Spain , Turkey , and the United Kingdom .

"text": "Boeing delivers final 717 to AirTran , ending Douglas era May 29 , 2006 Boeing Commercial Airplanes on Tuesday delivered the final 717 jet built to AirTran Airways in ceremonies in Long Beach , California , bringing production of McDonnell Douglas jets to an end . `` AirTran Airways would like to thank the many Boeing employees for their hard work and dedication over the years and enabling us to build a world-class aircraft fleet that is unparalleled in the aviation industry , '' said Joe Leonard , Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of AirTran Airways . The final Boeing 717 was the 15,599 th plane built by the Long Beach plant , the original home of Douglas Aircraft and McDonnell Douglas . It also marked the end of the popular DC-9 family of jets , which has sold over 2,400 units over its 41-year history . In 1995 , McDonnell Douglas introduced the MD-95 , which later became the Boeing 717 when McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1996 . The 717 had suffered from slow sales throughout its history , with 155 planes ordered . In January 2005 , Boeing announced that it would cancel the 717 program after completing all outstanding orders . The 717 program 's demise leaves the C-17 military cargo jet as the only remaining jet aircraft built in California . Some workers from the 717 program have transferred to the C-17 program . Its future is also uncertain as Boeing 's contract to produce the aircraft expires in 2008 .",

"text": "Boeing unveils long-range 777 February 17 , 2005 Boeing has unveiled a new ultra-long range version of its 777 airliner , capable of flying from London to Sydney non-stop . The 777-200LR can fly for 9,420 nautical miles ( 17,446 kilometers ) with 301 passengers onboard , giving it a range greater than any other airliner in the world . The aircraft can fly from New York to Singapore and from Los Angeles to Dubai with a full passenger and luggage load non-stop , and has been named the Worldliner by Boeing to mark the fact it can connect almost any two cities on Earth . Although it can fly from London to Sydney non-stop , the 777-200LR will have to break its return journey to refuel due to direction of the prevailing winds in the upper atmosphere . So far , Boeing has received five orders from two customers for the 777-200LR since it was announced in February 2000 . The first of the new airliner will be delivered to Pakistan International Airlines in January 2006 . EVA Airways is the other launch customer . First flight is scheduled in early March . The 777-200LR will be the basis for an all-freight version of the 777 , announced last November . Boeing 's European rival Airbus , which has out-sold Boeing since 2003 , believes that the future of passenger flight is in very large aircraft like its new twin-deck A380 airliner flying up to 840 people between a relatively small number of large hub airports world-wide . Passengers would then take connecting flights to reach their final destinations . Boeing , by contrast , believes passengers will want to fly direct between more local airports too small to handle aircraft like the A380 .",

"text": "Singapore Airlines to be compensated for A380 delays October 5 , 2006 Singapore Airlines says that it will be compensated by Airbus for the additional delay in delivery of its new superjumbo A380 's . The double-deck commercial aircrafts ' delivery , originally due later this year , will be delayed until October 2007 . The main fault has been found to be problems in the aircraft 's 500km of wiring . In a statement on the Airbus website , the company said that `` the root cause of the problem is the fact that the 3D Digital mock-up , which facilitates the design of the electrical harnesses installation , was implemented late and that the people working on it were in their learning curve '' . Airbus is currently two years behind schedule . In a statement , SIA said that , `` The delays are disappointing ; all the more so because the flight test and certification programme is proceeding well , and the delays are down to production issues . '' Analysts are predicting that the compensations could well run into a few hundred million US dollars . SIA has stated that the compensation details will be kept confidential Singapore Airlines is the first airline to fly the A380 and will be receiving the first four aircraft .",

"text": "Airbus announces job cuts of 10,000 February 28 , 2007 Airbus , Europe 's biggest aircraft manufacturer , has announced 10,000 job cuts over the next four years . The news comes as its parent company , EADS starts a major restructuring programme because the company is not efficient enough . Louis Gallois , the Airbus chief executive , said the company expects to cut approximately 4,300 jobs in France , 3,700 in Germany , 1,600 in UK and 400 in Spain . About half of those cuts will be made among subcontractors and temporary workers . Actual Airbus employee reduction would be about 5,000 , or 9 % of the total European work force of 55,000 full-time Airbus employees . Although Gallois said he hoped to achieve this mainly through attrition , the unions were displeased . Union officials said nearly 14,000 employees at four French sites had a two hour work stoppage Wednesday afternoon to protest the cuts . `` The response has been massive , '' said Julien Talavan , a spokesman for Force Ouvrière , the main Airbus union in France . `` This is just the beginning , '' he said , hinting at future labor action . This move comes after well-publicized delays on its A380 super-jumbo commercial airliner . The restructuring announcement also includes the proposed sale or closure of 3 plants .",

One of the A380s is flying from Frankfurt to Chicago via New York ; the airplane will be carrying about 500 people . It is being billed as the first time it has carried a near-normal number of passengers , though most will be staff of Airbus and German airline Lufthansa . A second A380 is also travelling to the U.S. on Monday , but without passengers . This will be branded as a Qantas flight and fly from Frankfurt to Los Angeles LAX airport . The first leg of the flight going towards New York will be travelling under a Lufthansa flight number , and is due to arrive at New York 's John F. Kennedy airport at 12:30 EST ( 16:30 UTC ) . The test flights are being used to monitor everything from how easily the plane docks at the terminal gate to the way the in-flight dining and entertainment services work . Deliveries to Singapore Airlines , its launch customer , are not due until October - two years late . Delays of the production of the A380 have cost Airbus more than 6 billion dollars . Airbus has warned there could be additional charges to come . These monetary problems have led to a recently-announced restructuring program at Airbus , called Power8 , in which 10,000 jobs go and several factories will be sold to Airbus partners . France will lose 4,300 jobs , followed by Germany having a loss of 3,700 jobs , while the United Kingdom and Spain will see 1,600 and 400 jobs cut respectively . The Belgian government has announced that it will give up to 150 million $ ( US$ 199 million ) in aid to help sub-contractors which supply Airbus and employ thousands of workers .",

"text": "Aer Lingus buys twelve new long-haul Airbus jets June 9 , 2007 Irish national airline Aer Lingus have purchased 12 new long-haul Airbus aircraft as a means of modernising it 's long-haul fleet and improving it 's transatlantic network . Under the agreement , Aer Lingus Group PLC said it will receive six new A330-300E aircraft from 2009 to 2011 , then between 2014 and 2016 it will take delivery of six new A350 XWB ( Extra Wide Body ) aircraft , a new design currently under development by Airbus . Aer Lingus also have options of six more A350s to exercise by 2018 . Aer Lingus already operates an all-Airbus fleet consisting of 30 short-haul aircraft ( 24 A320s and 6 A321s ) and eight long-haul A330s , and had made the purchase of new long-haul airliners a top priority since the formerly state-owned company was floated on British and Irish stock markets in September 2006 . The airline had approached Airbus rival Boeing regarding a potential deal for their new 787 aircraft , but Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion stated that he believed the Airbus aircraft were `` better on fuel and better on range '' than the 787 . He also said that , although the aircraft have a catalogue value of $ 1.78 billion ( US$ 2.4 billion ) , Airbus had offered them at an `` exceptional discounts '' on them . Some of the A330s will be replaced by the new aircraft . As well as new routes to the US , Mannion stated that there was a possibility of routes elsewhere resulting from the new aircraft as well , saying , `` We will prioritize the U.S. ( but ) we have an eye as to what 's happening to the Far East and South Africa . '' The airline already offers flights to New York , Boston , Chicago , Los Angeles , Dubai , and recently launched 3 new U.S. routes to San Francisco , Orlando , and Washington . Aer Lingus shares on the Irish Stock Exchange fell 2.5 percent to $ 2.73 ( $ 3.68 ) the day the deal was announced . It will fall through unless backed by shareholders . Aer Lingus rival Ryanair has been attempting to take over Aer Lingus since December , and if this bid is successful , the new aircraft may become redundant as Ryanair intends to end transatlantic services . However , the Irish government , which holds a 25 percent share in Aer Lingus , disapproves of the takeover , as do Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts that hold more than 15 percent shares . Ryanair owns a 25 percent share in Aer Lingus . The takeover is also unlikely to receive regulatory approval from the European Union . Mannion said of the integration of the new aircraft `` The A350 XWB fits in with our ambitious plans to expand existing routes and to open up new ones from our hub in Dublin . We already have an all Airbus fleet and the new aircraft will fit in seamlessly . ''",

"text": "Aeroflot negotiates purchase of 22 new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft June 10 , 2007 Russian flag carrier Aeroflot has negotiated the purchase of 22 new Boeing 787 Dreamliners , an aircraft Boeing currently has under development . The first jets will be delivered in 2014 . The Dreamliner will be the first commercial jet to be manufactured mainly with carbon-fiber composites instead of the aluminium previously used . The deal was announced during a large business forum that President Vladimir Putin had set up to showcase his country 's role in the international market . The deal was the centrepiece of the event . The sale is the result of a deal begun between Aeroflot and Chicago-based Boeing last year , but negotiations had stalled due to worsening relations between the US and Russia . Aeroflot has suffered as a result of the delay . If had the sale gone through last year , the aircraft would have been delivered by 2011 . The aircraft have a pre-modification catalogue value of US$ 3.5 billion , although neither of the companies involved would reveal the actual agreement reached between the two firms . When asked whether the deal should be seen as a step towards a resolution of the rift between Russia and the US , Boeing Executive Vice President Scott Carson replied , `` It represents a business relationship between our Company and Aeroflot , and I' m really proud of it , '' . Boeing has had a policy of Russian involvement dating back to the early 1990s . More recently , Boeing has entered into an agreement with Russian manufacturer Sukhoi for worldwide marketing and after-sales support for their regional aircraft , the Superjet , and have reached a deal with Kremlin-owned Unified Aircraft for general co-operation . They also have a Moscow design centre that has 1,400 employees and a 30-year contract for supply of titanium parts with Russia 's VSMPO-Avisma , which Boeing estimates to be worth $ 18 million . It has been reported that the deal between Boeing and Aeroflot was revived after Boeing promised that technical assistance would be provided to Aeroflot for the new aircraft . Aeroflot 's current fleet of Boeing and Airbus aircraft was built during the Soviet era . Aeroflot say that the deal does not affect plans to purchase new Airbuses at a later date for later delivery .",

Sunday was chosen as its date matches the aircraft 's designation number when written in the American format , 7/8/07 . The event was attended by 15,000 people including employees , customers , suppliers and officials from government and the local community . Scott Carson , president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said , `` This has been a wonderful and exciting day to celebrate this breakthrough airplane with our customers , employees , supplier partners and our communities . '' The mid-sized 787 will seat between 210 and 330 passengers , and will be the first commercial airliner of a mostly carbon fibre composites construction . Boeing claims that the resulting reduction of weight compared to the traditional aluminium will offer enhanced fuel efficiency , benefiting both operators and the environment . According to the company , the 787 Dreamliner will use 20 percent less fuel per passenger than similarly sized aircraft . On Saturday , Boeing announced 35 new orders from German airline Air Berlin and ALAFCO Aviation Lease & Finance of Kuwait , bringing the total to 677 orders from 47 customers . At the list price , these orders are worth US$ 5.62 billion . The first flight is expected to take place in August or September of this year , with the first customer , All Nippon Airways , due to receive their first aircraft in May 2008 . The 787 illustrates the differing strategies adopted by Boeing and Airbus whose double-decker A380 first flew in April 2005 and is expected to enter service later this year . Whereas the Airbus A380 is aimed at flying large passenger numbers between major hubs , the Dreamliner is targeted at smaller airports where Boeing predicts will be an area of growth in the industry . Earlier in the day , Boeing received a congratulatory letter from Airbus . The company president and CEO Louis Gallois said , `` Today is a great day in aviation history . For , whenever such a milestone is reached in our industry , it always is a reflection of hard work by dedicated people inspired by the wonder of flight . Even if tomorrow Airbus will get back to the business of competing vigorously , today is Boeing 's day -- a day to celebrate the 787 . ''",

The minor accident occurred during push back , as the aircraft was leaving a parking space before it was due to fly to Chiang Mai International Airport . As the jet was being pushed back by a Thai Airways International tug operator , the left winglet struck the side of the hangar , and was crumpled against it . The winglets , designed to improve fuel efficiency , are non-vital parts . After an inspection , Airbus decided to remove both winglets and continue the flight without them . The plane left four hours after its scheduled 9:45 a.m. local time departure , carrying 150 passengers . The flight was intended to counteract criticisms that the massive airliner , which has a 79-metre wingspan , is too big ( and thus too complex for ground crews ) to be practically operated at most airports . It also demonstrates continuing problems at Suvarnabhumi airport , which has suffered various incidents since it opened last September , the most severe of which being the discovery of large cracks in airport taxiways shortly after opening . Airbus has said they will continue with their tour of Asia demonstrating the plane .",

"text": "Indonesia 's transport minister tells airlines not to buy European aircraft due to EU ban December 20 , 2007 Jusman Syafii Djamal , minister of transport for Indonesia , has recommended that local airlines should not purchase aircraft from European manufacturers , such as Airbus . It is a direct response to the decision of the European Union ( EU ) to add all 51 of Indonesia 's air carriers to the list of air carriers banned in the EU . The EU made the decision to ban the Indonesian air traffic due to a string of accidents in the country , including two major disasters this year - the losses of Adam Air Flight 574 and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 , which killed 102 and 21 people respectively . `` We do not need to buy aircraft from Europe as long as the flying ban stays unrevoked , '' Detik.com quoted Djamal as saying , although Xinhua translated the quote as : `` As long as the ban is still in place , it is better we do not buy [ aircraft ] from Europe . '' `` If aircraft are purchased and registered as Indonesian [ in Europe ] , we are worried the planes wo n't be able to fly to Indonesia because Indonesian airlines ' aircraft are banned from flying over Europe , '' he continued . Djamal is concerned that instead new European planes would have to be flown into Indonesia prior to registration , with higher costs incurred as a result . The announcement , which had already been issued to airlines two weeks ago , was made at a joint press conference with Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla in Jakarta . Djamal told reporters that he felt the best option was the lifting of the ban . `` The easiest way is to lift the ban , because the ban goes against the principle of open sky policy , '' he said . Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has already postponed a diplomatic visit to Europe , citing the ban as his reason . Normally , the president flies on an aircraft operated by state-owned national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia . A European Commission review was held in Brussels on November 28 . Although bans were lifted on Pakistani flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines and Surinam carrier Blue Wing Airlines , the sanctions on Indonesian airlines remained in force . Multiple local air carriers are considering the possibility of fleet expansions , with some evaluating Airbus jets as possible options . Airbus , in particular , charge an added cost for taking an aircraft to Indonesia for registration . `` There is an additional cost that must be paid by Indonesian airlines that buy the ( Airbus ) plane from Europe , US$ 200,000 , '' said Djamal . `` Because of that we recommend not buying planes from Europe . As long as the EU ban is still in place , there will be additional payment . '' However , he went on to say that should a manufacturer be willing to pay the cost itself , he did not object to the purchase of the aircraft . He has also confirmed that no Indonesian officers will be sent to Europe to assist with the situation .",

"text": "World 's largest passenger airliner makes first flight April 27 , 2005 The world 's largest passenger aircraft , the Airbus A380 , has made its maiden flight after lifting off from Toulouse in France . The take-off , at 08:30 UTC , was apparently normal and took place exactly on time . The aircraft flew into clear blue skies with a flight crew of six ( all wearing parachutes as a safety precaution ) and twenty tonnes of test equipment on board . Around 50,000 people watched the maiden flight , many sitting on grass banks lining the runway . More people watched the flight on a giant screen erected in the centre of Toulouse . The test flight lasted four hours , with the aircraft flying no higher than 10,000 nor further than 100 miles from Toulouse as it circled the Bay of Biscay . The A380 , known for many years during its development phase as the Airbus A3XX , will be the largest airliner in the world by a substantial margin when it enters service . The first A380 prototype was unveiled during a lavish ceremony in Toulouse , France , on January 18 , 2005 . Its manufacturer 's serial number is 001 , and it is registered F-WWOW . The new Airbus will initially be sold in two versions : the A380-800 , a full double-decker configuration , able to carry 555 passengers in a three-class configuration or up to 800 passengers in a single-class economy configuration . Range for the A380-800 model is expected to be 8,000 nautical miles ( 14,800 km ) . The second model , the A380-800F dedicated freighter , will carry 150 tons of cargo 5,600 miles ( 10,400 km ) . The cost of the project so far is # 8.4 bn , # 1bn over budget . 144 planes have already been ordered . Singapore Airlines , which will be the first company to operate the new air giant , in July 2006 , have opened a reservation site for this first regular flight .",
